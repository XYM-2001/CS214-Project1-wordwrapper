We used the example in the p1.pdf and the output is correct. In addition, we tested other cases so we think the ww.c is correct.
 
TESTING CASES:
Based on the 3 scenarios(argument with size only, size and a file name, 
 
size and a directory), we tested both 3 scenarios so that our program 
 
can read from standard input, wrap and write to standard output, read 
 
from a file, wrap and write to standard output, read from files in a 
 
directory, wrap and create or overwrite a wrapped file with prefix of 
 
the previous file name. We adjusted the text of the files to make sure 
 
our program can deal with different situations(like a file starts with 
 
a bunch of whitespace, has several paragraphs with more than 2 /n).
